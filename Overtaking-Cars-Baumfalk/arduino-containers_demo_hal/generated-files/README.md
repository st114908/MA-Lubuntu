# Generated Code

The generated code is organized in the following subdirectories:

## APImappings

The method stubs are created as part of the Arduino Container Code generator. Their implementation was not generated using the ApiML and ApiMappingML, but implemented manually using the robotCarLibs.

## fastAndSlowCar_v2

This directory contains all the code generated by the C Component Type Code Generation

## mosquitto

The generated Docker configuration for starting up a mosquitto MQTT Sever, see ```README.txt```.

## MUML_Container.muml_container

The MUML model generated by the container transformation. MQTT and I2C were selected as the middleware configuration.

## README.txt

The README file generated by the Arduino Container Code generator.

## The other directories

The other directories contain the code generated by the Arduino Container Code generator. The container code provides the environment for the component code to be executed on the ECUs of each robot car.
